# Goal:

Greater Metro Vancouver is home to one of the most expensiv real estate markets in North America. Therefore, we want to help
users gain insight in the real estate market and make informed decisions when they are considering buying a home.


We want to help users to predict prices of a home (house or apartment) given house attributes such as age of the house,
location, number of bedrooms, land size, etc...


# Questions We Want to Answer:
- How do cities/neighbourhoods compare in terms of price?
    - Which areas in greater vancouver are most/least expensive? And by how much?
- Can we build a model to determine if the home listing is under-valued or over-valued?
- How has the housing market changed in Greater Vancouver over the last two years?
- What is the average house lot size for each city?
- What is the average income of a household to be able to purchase a home at a given city?
- ...


# Challenges:

Inaccuracies: Because our data is taken from public listings websites, we do not have the price of listing at which the 
house is sold, only the sellers asking price for the home. 
This means that the prices in our dataset can vary from the true price value becuase sellers 
usually list their houses at a lower asking price to attract more buyers.


# Road Map:
1. scrape data
1. clean data
1. model data

1. build a website that helps user predict the price of their ideal
